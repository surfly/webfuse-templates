## Description
This space contains an extension that takes an existing [accessibility widget](https://github.com/PrabothCharith/accessibility-plugin) from a public github repository. 
The extension adds additional logic to use the widget within Webfuse. This includes maintaining state between tabs & pre-defining the widget settings with extension variables.

## How to Use
Import this space and the extension will be inclided. Once imported, open your new space and edit the extension variables to your preferences. These will save and each new session will begin with your configured settings in place. 
The widget will load in each page visited and maintain state between them for the duration of the session as settings are updated by the user. When the session ends, the next session will revert back to the settings declared in the extension variables:
